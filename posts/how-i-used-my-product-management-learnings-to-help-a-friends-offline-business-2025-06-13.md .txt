# How I Used My Product Management Learnings to Help a Friend’s Offline Business

It all started when I was having a conversation with my childhood friend who owns a baby product shop in a small town in India.

He asked me, “We have been friends for so long but I still do not know what you do for work.”

I told him about Product Management and tried to explain it with the usual jargon—but obviously, he got confused. Then I simplified: we identify problems that customers face and solve them in a way that's good for both the customer and the business.

Then he asked me a very thought-provoking question:  
> “I, as a business, am facing a problem that my sales have been flat for a very long time and now with rising inflation I am struggling. Why don't you help me solve my business problem—or can you only do it in the tech sector?”

That got me thinking. I decided to use a PM-style approach to identify and solve his problem.

## Step 1: Diagnose the Funnel

The first thing I did was analyze his sales funnel:

- **Walk-ins per day**
- **Conversion rate** – how many visitors buy something
- **Average order value**
- **Repeat rate** and **Customer LTV** (limited to early-age parenting segment)

He didn’t have exact data but had approximate insights:

- **Conversion rate:** ~90% (extremely high)
- **AOV:** ₹1000
- **Repeat rate:** 8–10 times/year
- **Brand presence:** 20-year-old shop with high trust

This suggested the issue was **top of the funnel**: footfall.

## The Real Problem

Footfall had been decreasing steadily for 5 years due to rising e-commerce adoption in Tier-3 cities. His competitors had deep discounts and endless variety. But we had clarity on the problem: **Increase footfall**.

## Step 2: Identify Strengths and Differentiators

We asked:

- What are new parent pain points?
- How can we turn strengths into differentiation?

**Pain Points:**
- Parents lack structured knowledge in early parenting
- Don’t know what products they’ll need ahead of time
- Online delivery is slow (3–4 days minimum)

**Shop’s Strengths:**
- Trusted 20-year local brand
- Owner gives personal product advice
- Can provide same-day delivery

---

## Step 3: Execute the Solution

We crafted a solution to turn insight into traction:

- Curated **essential packages** by age group (0–3 months, 3–6 months, etc.)
- Designed an **infographic pamphlet** with:
  - Key parenting tips
  - FAQs
  - QR code to a landing page
- Landing page showed:
  - Packages + discounts
  - WhatsApp link to order
  - Store location
- Partnered with 5 hospitals & 25 clinics
  - Paid local chemists to insert pamphlets with each order

## Results

The outcome was beyond our expectations:

- **Week 1:**  
  - 140 inquiries  
  - 80 orders  
  - 20 in-store visits

- **Week 2:**  
  - 200 inquiries  
  - 60% conversion rate

- **Impact:**  
  - Sales up **130%**  
  - Cost: ₹1000 per center → ₹30,000/month total

---

## Key Learnings

- Product thinking can solve **offline problems** just as well.
- Provide value first—trust follows.
- Talk to people around you. Solutions can come from unexpected places.

## What’s Next?

- My friend now knows how to:
  - Build & manage a landing page
  - Use WhatsApp Business
- Next step: setting up **CRM** and structured retention campaigns using newly collected customer data.
