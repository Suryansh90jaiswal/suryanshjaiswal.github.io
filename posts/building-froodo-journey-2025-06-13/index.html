<p>Embarking on an entrepreneurial journey feels like assembling a parachute mid-fall. Here&rsquo;s my story from 2018.</p>
<p>In 2018, I co-founded <strong>Froodo</strong>, a subscription-based healthy snacking business delivering fresh, chilled cut fruit boxes to customers&rsquo; doorsteps. It wasn&rsquo;t just a business — it was a crash course in customer acquisition, growth hacking, hiring, finance, operations, and customer service.</p>
<h2 id="the-aha-moment-identifying-the-problem">The AHA Moment: Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>The idea came from a personal pain point.</p>
<p>Late afternoons at the office meant hunger. Most days, we reached for unhealthy street food. One day, passing fresh fruit stalls, it hit us: <em>what if someone delivered assorted, chilled fruit directly to the office?</em></p>
<p>That was the AHA. A clear gap in the market for convenient, healthy snacks — especially for urban professionals.</p>
<h2 id="the-early-days-building-from-scratch">The Early Days: Building from Scratch</h2>
<p>Two days later, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporated the company.</li>
<li>Rented a tiny commercial space.</li>
<li>Hired our first team via classified ads — a delivery person and a kitchen assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>No roadmap. Just execution.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-big-hurdle-getting-customers">The First Big Hurdle: Getting Customers</h2>
<p>We had the kitchen. We had the staff. What we didn’t have? Customers.</p>
<p>We built a nice website, created subscription packages, and launched an Instagram. Nothing moved.</p>
<p>So we tried something scrappy: we joined Facebook food groups and posed as happy customers. It worked. Five orders on Day 1. The thrill was better than a paycheck.</p>
<h2 id="growth-hacking-and-scaling">Growth Hacking and Scaling</h2>
<p>From five to <strong>500 daily orders in six months</strong>. No ad spend.</p>
<p>Just relentless iteration, community hacks, and product-market fit.</p>
<h2 id="customer-empathy-and-feedback">Customer Empathy and Feedback</h2>
<p>We handled every query ourselves.</p>
<p>That direct feedback loop shaped our offering. It also taught me something foundational — customer empathy is a superpower.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-the-team-lean-and-efficient">Keeping the Team Lean and Efficient</h2>
<p>We hired smart and lean.</p>
<p>We provided accommodation for staff, so they lived where they worked. This eliminated commuting, allowed 24/7 shifts, and kept operating costs low.</p>
<h2 id="go-to-market-strategy">Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
<p>With no marketing budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collaborated with local wellness influencers.</li>
<li>Created valuable health content on social.</li>
<li>Distributed free trial boxes at health fairs.</li>
<li>Focused on word-of-mouth and community hacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results-and-impact">Results and Impact</h2>
<p>Within one year: <strong>500 daily orders</strong>.</p>
<p>Driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A real customer need.</li>
<li>Fast, scrappy execution.</li>
<li>Customer-first feedback loops.</li>
<li>Data-driven iteration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building Froodo wasn’t just a startup story. It was my bootcamp in product-market fit, zero-budget marketing, and team-driven scale.</p>
<p>The lessons? Still relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start from pain.</li>
<li>Ship fast.</li>
<li>Talk to your customers.</li>
<li>Stay lean. Iterate. Scale.</li>
</ul>
