<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I joined <strong>SWVL</strong> in February 2021, just after the pandemic, to lead growth products. One of the most promising levers was the <strong>Packages</strong> product—a prepaid ride bundle that allowed users to buy multiple rides at a discount.</p>
<p>For users: it meant lower per-ride costs.<br>
For SWVL: it drove higher <strong>LTV</strong>, <strong>retention</strong>, and <strong>ride frequency</strong>.<br>
The mission was clear: increase package sales to directly impact <strong>GMV</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="product-discovery-and-data-analysis">Product Discovery and Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The discovery phase revealed a critical issue:<br>
<strong>Only 5% of users ever saw the Packages screen.</strong><br>
Out of those, <strong>40% converted</strong>, yet overall penetration sat at <strong>just 2%</strong>.</p>
<p>The opportunity was obvious. We didn’t need to change the product. We needed people to find it.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-customer-needs">Understanding Customer Needs</h2>
<p>Customer interviews validated what the data suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users liked the idea of packages.</li>
<li>But they missed it—tucked deep inside the app.</li>
<li>Savings weren’t obvious — users had to manually calculate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We weren’t surfacing the right message at the right moment.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-implementation-using-frameworks">Strategic Implementation Using Frameworks</h2>
<h3 id="hooked-model-building-discovery-loops">Hooked Model: Building Discovery Loops</h3>
<p>To improve visibility, I applied the <strong>Hooked Model</strong> (Trigger → Action → Reward → Investment):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Push notifications when ride usage spiked.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Moved “Packages” to the home screen.</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong>: Highlighted total savings upon package purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>: Reinforced by usage—each ride drew from the prepaid package.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nudge-theory-driving-behavior-through-context">Nudge Theory: Driving Behavior Through Context</h3>
<p>Behavior is shaped by context.</p>
<p>We introduced <strong>contextual nudges</strong> at the ride-booking stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of just “Book Ride for $10”, users saw:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Book Ride: $10</strong></li>
<li><strong>Book for $5 (with a Package)</strong></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This created a subtle decision-making tension. Users naturally leaned toward value.</p>
<h2 id="cross-selling-initiatives">Cross-Selling Initiatives</h2>
<p>We embedded <strong>cross-sell prompts</strong> across the funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a user regularly rode a certain route, they saw a personalized package offer.</li>
<li>Messaging focused on <strong>savings</strong> and <strong>convenience</strong>.</li>
<li>The goal: meet users where they were, not ask them to explore elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>The risk? Conversion could drop. Cross-sell at the final funnel stage might distract or confuse users.</p>
<p>We couldn’t afford a drop in rides.</p>
<h2 id="gtm-strategy">GTM Strategy</h2>
<p>To mitigate risk, we <strong>soft-launched</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolled out cross-sell to a low-conversion cohort (infrequent riders).</li>
<li>Tracked conversion <em>and</em> package adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results were strong across both metrics, giving us confidence to <strong>scale to 100%</strong> of users.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-impact">Results and Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> of Packages jumped from 5% → 100%.</li>
<li><strong>Package penetration</strong> grew from 2% → <strong>12%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>GMV</strong> rose by <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A strategic mix of behavior design, data-driven targeting, and staged rollout made it possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project sharpened my belief in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with data. Let it reveal blind spots.</li>
<li>Build around user psychology. Subtle nudges win.</li>
<li>Don’t guess. Rollout iteratively and validate before scaling.</li>
</ul>
<p>At SWVL, we didn’t just sell more packages—we reengineered how users discovered value.</p>
