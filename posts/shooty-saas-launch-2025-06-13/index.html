<h2 id="starting-from-scratch">Starting from Scratch</h2>
<p>When I left SWVL, I joined <strong>Shooty</strong>, an early-stage startup with no product vision and a small tech team. The shift—from a structured product environment to a blank slate—forced me to build everything from the ground up.</p>
<p>The first challenge: what are we building?<br>
The second: who do we need to build it?</p>
<h2 id="establishing-a-product-vision">Establishing a Product Vision</h2>
<p>Shooty aimed to simplify content creation for digital creators. I narrowed the product vision to three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive Workspaces</strong> – A clean, flexible interface for managing creative projects.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Tools</strong> – Real-time communication and asset sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control</strong> – Built-in review and approval workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>This became the product north star.</p>
<h2 id="product-discovery-leveraging-a-strategic-advantage">Product Discovery: Leveraging a Strategic Advantage</h2>
<p>Shooty was born from <strong>Shapes Defined Photography</strong>, a premium e-commerce studio. This gave me direct access to our future customers—content creators and photographers.</p>
<h3 id="my-process">My Process</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong> – To surface pain points and existing tool gaps.</li>
<li><strong>User Surveys</strong> – To prioritize feature development.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong> – To observe workflows and friction points.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong> – To understand table stakes and whitespace.</li>
<li><strong>Persona Creation</strong> – To anchor development decisions around user archetypes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frameworks-used">Frameworks Used</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)</strong> – To map needs based on outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy Maps</strong> – To visualize motivation and friction.</li>
<li><strong>Lean Canvas</strong> – To test assumptions across value prop, channels, and cost structures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="validating-the-solution">Validating the Solution</h2>
<p>We moved fast but methodically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prototyping</strong> – For quick visual feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Usability Testing</strong> – To test interaction assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Testing</strong> – With high-context users from Shapes Defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each iteration validated the core hypothesis: creative workflows are fragmented, and there’s a gap between asset creation and review.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-lean-global-team">Building a Lean, Global Team</h2>
<p>We didn’t raise a large round. Every rupee mattered.</p>
<ul>
<li>We aimed to hire <strong>8 engineers</strong>.</li>
<li>We shipped v1 with <strong>4</strong>—cutting tech costs by <strong>50%</strong>.</li>
<li>We hired globally, using strict filters for quality and alignment.</li>
<li>Cultural fit, autonomy, and velocity were non-negotiables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: a lean team, shipping fast and in sync.</p>
<h2 id="development-and-execution">Development and Execution</h2>
<p>We adopted <strong>agile</strong> to stay responsive.<br>
A major win: a <strong>workflow engine</strong> tailored for high-volume photo shoots.<br>
It increased processing throughput by <strong>30%</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="go-to-market-strategy">Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
<p>There was no marketing team, no big budget.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Personally researched, shortlisted, and pitched <strong>agencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Used criteria like: past performance, domain familiarity, alignment with our GTM velocity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="channels-used">Channels Used:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social media groups</strong> (targeted outreach).</li>
<li><strong>Micro-influencers</strong> (niche credibility, low CAC).</li>
<li><strong>Referral incentives</strong> (product-led growth loops).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-launch">The Launch</h2>
<p>The beta went live.</p>
<ul>
<li>We launched with a tight GTM plan.</li>
<li>Secured <strong>5000 signups in the first month</strong>.</li>
<li>All with limited paid spend and no VC splash.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results proved our hypothesis and unlocked a strong word-of-mouth loop.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Limited resources.</li>
<li>Technical infrastructure built from scratch.</li>
<li>High user expectations from creators familiar with polished tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>But each challenge refined our execution muscle.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What Shooty taught me:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sharp product vision matters more than a big team.</li>
<li>Close user proximity reduces waste.</li>
<li>Clear focus and structured discovery cut through ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn’t just launch a SaaS product—we proved it’s possible to go from 0 to thousands of users with lean ops and first-principles thinking.</p>
