      <h2 id="company-background">Company Background</h2>
<p>Nykaa is a leading beauty and wellness e-commerce platform in India, offering a wide range of products from top brands. With a valuation of $6 billion and a successful IPO on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Nykaa has become a household name in the Indian market.</p>
<h2 id="project-context">Project Context</h2>
<p>In 2016, as the Head of Product and Analytics at Nykaa, I was tasked with optimizing the user journey during high-traffic Mega Sales events. During these sales, traffic typically spiked 4-5x, but we noticed a <strong>1% drop in conversion rates</strong>.</p>
<p>Key insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only <strong>30% of visitors</strong> landed on the designated Sales Page, which had <strong>3x higher conversion rates</strong>.</li>
<li>A significant portion of users were spending <strong>5+ minutes browsing</strong> without adding items to their carts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>How can we guide these browsing users to the high-converting Sales Page during a Mega Sale, without disrupting their experience?</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>We implemented a subtle <strong>bottom slider</strong> targeting users who had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent over 5 minutes browsing.</li>
<li>Viewed multiple product pages but hadn‚Äôt added items to their cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The slider message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou are missing out on buying your favorite product at 50%! Click here to know how.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The slider linked directly to the Sales Page, leveraging the urgency of the sale and the user&rsquo;s browsing behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>65% Click-Through Rate (CTR)</strong> on the slider, compared to a standard 10% CTR for similar messages.</li>
<li>Traffic to the Sales Page increased from <strong>30% to 50%</strong> of total visitors.</li>
<li>Overall <strong>sales revenue increased by 10%</strong> during the Mega Sale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-impact">Long-term Impact</h2>
<p>The success of this simple nudge led to its adoption as a standard practice for all major sales campaigns. Eventually, Nykaa even made the Sales Page the default homepage during Mega Sales events.</p>
<h2 id="key-learnings">Key Learnings</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>User behavior during sales differs drastically</strong> from regular browsing patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Timely, targeted UI nudges</strong> can significantly lift conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous testing and iteration</strong> are critical for optimizing e-commerce sales funnels.</li>
</ol>
