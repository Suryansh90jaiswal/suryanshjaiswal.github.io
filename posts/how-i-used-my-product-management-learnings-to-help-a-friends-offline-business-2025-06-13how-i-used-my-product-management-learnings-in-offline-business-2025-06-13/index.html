<p>It all started when I was having a conversation with my childhood friend who owns a baby product shop in a small town in India.</p>
<p>He asked me, “We have been friends for so long but I still do not know what you do for work.”</p>
<p>I told him about Product Management and tried to explain it with the usual jargon—but obviously, he got confused. Then I simplified: we identify problems that customers face and solve them in a way that&rsquo;s good for both the customer and the business.</p>
<p>Then he asked me a very thought-provoking question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I, as a business, am facing a problem that my sales have been flat for a very long time and now with rising inflation I am struggling. Why don&rsquo;t you help me solve my business problem—or can you only do it in the tech sector?”</p></blockquote>
<p>That got me thinking. I decided to use a PM-style approach to identify and solve his problem.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-diagnose-the-funnel">Step 1: Diagnose the Funnel</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was analyze his sales funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walk-ins per day</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conversion rate</strong> – how many visitors buy something</li>
<li><strong>Average order value</strong></li>
<li><strong>Repeat rate</strong> and <strong>Customer LTV</strong> (limited to early-age parenting segment)</li>
</ul>
<p>He didn’t have exact data but had approximate insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversion rate:</strong> ~90% (extremely high)</li>
<li><strong>AOV:</strong> ₹1000</li>
<li><strong>Repeat rate:</strong> 8–10 times/year</li>
<li><strong>Brand presence:</strong> 20-year-old shop with high trust</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggested the issue was <strong>top of the funnel</strong>: footfall.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-problem">The Real Problem</h2>
<p>Footfall had been decreasing steadily for 5 years due to rising e-commerce adoption in Tier-3 cities. His competitors had deep discounts and endless variety. But we had clarity on the problem: <strong>Increase footfall</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-identify-strengths-and-differentiators">Step 2: Identify Strengths and Differentiators</h2>
<p>We asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are new parent pain points?</li>
<li>How can we turn strengths into differentiation?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pain Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parents lack structured knowledge in early parenting</li>
<li>Don’t know what products they’ll need ahead of time</li>
<li>Online delivery is slow (3–4 days minimum)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shop’s Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trusted 20-year local brand</li>
<li>Owner gives personal product advice</li>
<li>Can provide same-day delivery</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-execute-the-solution">Step 3: Execute the Solution</h2>
<p>We crafted a solution to turn insight into traction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curated <strong>essential packages</strong> by age group (0–3 months, 3–6 months, etc.)</li>
<li>Designed an <strong>infographic pamphlet</strong> with:
<ul>
<li>Key parenting tips</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>QR code to a landing page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Landing page showed:
<ul>
<li>Packages + discounts</li>
<li>WhatsApp link to order</li>
<li>Store location</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partnered with 5 hospitals &amp; 25 clinics
<ul>
<li>Paid local chemists to insert pamphlets with each order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The outcome was beyond our expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>140 inquiries</li>
<li>80 orders</li>
<li>20 in-store visits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>200 inquiries</li>
<li>60% conversion rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sales up <strong>130%</strong></li>
<li>Cost: ₹1000 per center → ₹30,000/month total</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-learnings">Key Learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Product thinking can solve <strong>offline problems</strong> just as well.</li>
<li>Provide value first—trust follows.</li>
<li>Talk to people around you. Solutions can come from unexpected places.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>My friend now knows how to:
<ul>
<li>Build &amp; manage a landing page</li>
<li>Use WhatsApp Business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next step: setting up <strong>CRM</strong> and structured retention campaigns using newly collected customer data.</li>
</ul>
